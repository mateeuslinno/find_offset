# find_offset
This script helps found offsets base for Jailbreak. 

I tested in iOS kernel 14; 

 This version I'm looking directly symbols but the next release I'll look directly by offsets offset because the news version of kernel hasn't symbols.

 To do: 
 - Implement Jtool2; 
 - Implement capstone;
 - Testing others kernel version 
 - Solution for iOS 15
